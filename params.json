This write is designed to be used as a code kata or first steps for aspiring web devs. \r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis guide (when complete) will walk through:\r\n  - [ ] html\r\n  - [ ] css\r\n  - [ ] javascript\r\n  - [ ] implementing mobile responsive site with bootstrap \r\n  - [ ] use github to backup and share projects (agile development method, continuous integration)\r\n  - [ ] use github pages to host our site (for free!)\r\n  - [ ] use jekyll, a \"blog-aware, static site generator\", to manage our site\r\n  - [ ] maybe even convert readers to be a die hard vim enthusiast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCodeAcademy\r\n===========\r\n[CodeAcadmey](http://www.codecademy.com/) is awesome!\r\n\r\nSee this [nytimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/technology/for-an-edge-on-the-internet-computer-code-gains-a-following.html?_r=0)\r\n\r\n   \r\n```\r\ncodeacademy.com:\r\n  \"The sites and services catering to the learn-to-program market number in the dozens.\" \r\n\r\n  \"...at the center of the recent frenzy in this field is Codecademy, a start-up based \r\n  in New York that walks site visitors through interactive lessons in various computing\r\n  and Web languages, like JavaScript, and shows them how to write simple commands.\r\n\r\n  Since the service was introduced last summer, more than a million people have signed \r\n  up, and it has raisednearly $3 million in venture financing.\"\r\n  \r\n  Codecademy got a big break in January when Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, \r\n  made a public New Yearâ€™s resolution to use the site to learn how to code. The site is free. \r\n  Its creators hope to make money in part by connecting newly hatched programmers with \r\n  recruiters and start-ups.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWhen learning a new technology it can be rough due to the inevitable 'gotchas' that come with working not knowing what you dont know. CodeAcademy has you covered with tutorials, built in editors, instant feedback and a preview window that can be put into fullscreen. \r\n\r\nOk, enough background/intro/filler, lets code cool stuff!\r\n\r\nMake a Website\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks: \r\n------\r\n\r\n- [Google it!](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=learn+to+code+websites)\r\n- [http://blog.ted.com/ - 10 places where anyone can learn to code](http://blog.ted.com/2013/01/29/10-places-where-anyone-can-learn-to-code/)\r\n  - [nytimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/technology/for-an-edge-on-the-internet-computer-code-gains-a-following.html?_r=0)\r\n\r\n2. http://www.w3schools.com/website/default.asp\r\n3. http://learnwebcode.com/start-here/\r\n\r\nUseful: \r\n-------\r\n-  https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet\r\n-  http://www.iuniverse.com/ExpertAdvice/EditorialGuidelines/Parts.aspx\r\n-  http://www.codecademy.com/en/goals/web-beginner-en-3pc6w\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
