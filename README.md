codeacademy.com:
  "The sites and services catering to the learn-to-program market number in the dozens." 

  "...at the center of the recent frenzy in this field is Codecademy, a start-up based 
  in New York that walks site visitors through interactive lessons in various computing
  and Web languages, like JavaScript, and shows them how to write simple commands.

  Since the service was introduced last summer, more than a million people have signed 
  up, and it has raisednearly $3 million in venture financing."
  
  Codecademy got a big break in January when Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, 
  made a public New Yearâ€™s resolution to use the site to learn how to code. The site is free. 
  Its creators hope to make money in part by connecting newly hatched programmers with 
  recruiters and start-ups.
