Preface
--------

Whether picking up a new skill or refreshing on long forgotten syntax we often ask whats the fastest, most effiecent way to go from 0 to proficent/shippable/expert. This write is designed to be used as a code kata or first steps for aspiring web devs.

-----------

This guide (when complete) will walk through:
  - [ ] html

  - [ ] maybe even convert readers to be a die hard vim enthusiast





CodeAcademy
===========
CodeAcadmey is awesome!

See this [nytimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/technology/for-an-edge-on-the-internet-computer-code-gains-a-following.html?_r=0)

    ```
codeacademy.com:
  "The sites and services catering to the learn-to-program market number in the dozens." 

  "...at the center of the recent frenzy in this field is Codecademy, a start-up based 
  in New York that walks site visitors through interactive lessons in various computing
  and Web languages, like JavaScript, and shows them how to write simple commands.

  Since the service was introduced last summer, more than a million people have signed 
  up, and it has raisednearly $3 million in venture financing."
  
  Codecademy got a big break in January when Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, 
  made a public New Yearâ€™s resolution to use the site to learn how to code. The site is free. 
  Its creators hope to make money in part by connecting newly hatched programmers with 
  recruiters and start-ups.

Features: 

When learning a new technology it can be rough due to the inevitable 'gotchas' that come with working not knowing what you dont know. CodeAcademy has you covered with tutorials, built in editors, instant feedback and a preview window that can be put into fullscreen. 

Ok, enough background/intro/filler, lets code cool stuff!
